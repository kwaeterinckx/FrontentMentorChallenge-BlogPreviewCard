## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use the :has pseudo class to add the hover effect only when the blog title is focussed, not the link in the tag.  
And I discovered, by trying, that you can nest a **:is** in a **:has** ðŸ¤©

```css
.blog__article:has(.blog__title__link:is(:hover, :focus-visible)) {
  box-shadow: 17px 17px 0 var(--clr-black);
}
```

I used more semantic html elements, like the `<time>` tag for the publication date.

```html
<p class="blog__pub-date">Published <time datetime="2023-12-21">21 Dec 2023</time></p>
```

### Continued development

Hover effects are part of the design. With the last pseudo class selectors, it becomes easier to implement cool
hover effects without JS.  
I always struggled to make it look nice, but with :has *(and also :focus-within)*, I can add that extra touch that makes it awesome.
